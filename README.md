# Wargroove Expanded Editor 3

An Expanded Editor mod developed on the Official Modpacker.

Inspired and based off the [Expanded Editor](https://www.nexusmods.com/wargroove/mods/28) mod by Unicarn, this one aims to bring the mod tools without reliance upon the unsupported [Unofficial Modpacker](https://www.nexusmods.com/wargroove/mods/1).

The first mod to provide this functionality was the [Unlock Hidden Map Editor Contents](https://www.nexusmods.com/wargroove/mods/11) mod by Ophelia, making this the third mod in a series of editor feature mods!

## Features

* Reveals hidden Map Editor options including:
  * Decorations
  * Commanders
  * Event Conditions
  * Event Actions
  * Music
  * Location highlights
  * Terrain
  * Cutscene backgrounds
  * Cutscene props
  * Cutscene SFX
  * Cutscene VFX
  * Placable units
  * Dialogue portraits
* Removes unlock requirements for the three unlockable commanders including:
  * Mercival
  * Elodie
  * Dark Mercia

## How to Use

Load up a custom map you want to work on, open the "Mods" menu and enable the Expanded Editor mod. Click "Reload map" and all of the features should now be accessible! When you're finished and wish to upload your map, simply disable the mod.

None of your changes to the map will be lost when the mod is removed, as they are all used in vanilla WarGroove!

Unlockable content will return to being locked once the mod is removed if you have not yet unlocked them.

## Installation

Download the latest release file of the packed mod. Drop the mod folder into your mods folder in the `%appdata%/chucklefish/wargroove/mods` directory. Reload your game and it should now show up in your "Mods" menu in the map editor.

Mods are currently only available for Windows Steam versions. It is not usable for XBox Gamepass, MacOS, or console versions.

## Missing Features and Known Issues

Due to limitations of the Official Modpacker, not all features possible in the [Expanded Editor](https://www.nexusmods.com/wargroove/mods/28) mod by Unicarn are available. If you absolutely require these, I highly recommend installing and learning to use the [Unofficial Modpacker](https://www.nexusmods.com/wargroove/mods/1). These features include:

* No access to hidden menuing for map or player properties. This includes:
  * Exporting Campaign maps to individual map files
  * Importing working maps into a Campaign
  * Stars requirements to play maps
  * Screen filters
* Input restraints removed. This includes:
  * Negative starting gold for players

These aside, the mod also currently has these limitations that may be implemented in the future:
* The Loaded Thief unit type is not placable
