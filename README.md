# Wargroove Expanded Editor 3

An Expanded Editor mod developed on the Official Modpacker.

Inspired and based off the [Expanded Editor](https://www.nexusmods.com/wargroove/mods/28) mod by Unicarn, this one aims to bring the mod tools without reliance upon the unsupported [Unofficial Modpacker](https://www.nexusmods.com/wargroove/mods/1), and continuing the trend of Expanded Editor mods.

## Features

* Reveals hidden Map Editor options including:
  * Decorations
  * Commanders
  * Event Conditions
  * Event Actions
  * Music
  * Location highlights
  * Terrain
  * Cutscene backgrounds
  * Cutscene props
  * Cutscene SFX
  * Cutscene VFX
  * Placable units
  * Dialogue portraits
* Removes unlock requirements for the three unlockable commanders including:
  * Mercival
  * Elodie
  * Dark Mercia

## How to Use

Load up a custom map you want to work on, open the "Mods" menu and enable the Expanded Editor mod. Click "Reload map" and all of the features should now be accessible! When you're finished and wish to upload your map, simply disable the mod.

None of these changes will be lost when the mod is removed, as they are all used in vanilla WarGroove!

## Installation

Download the latest release file of the packed mod. Drop the mod folder into your mods folder in the `%appdata%/chucklefish/wargroove/mods` directory. Reload your game and it should now show up in your "Mods" menu in the map editor.

Mods are currently only available for Windows Steam versions. It is not usable for XBox Gamepass, MacOS, or console versions.

## Missing Features and Known Issues

* Currently no access to hidden menuing for map or player properties. This includes:
  * Export and Import of maps to campaigns
  * Stars requirements to play maps
* The Loaded Thief unit type is not placable
